question: |
  Welcome to the Do-It-Yourself Motion Regarding Change of Domicile tool
subquestion: |
  This tool can help you prepare the forms to file a *Motion Regarding Change of Domicile* in Michigan.

id: MLH intro landing
question: |
  Need more help?
subquestion: |
  This tool will help you prepare forms for your legal issue without a lawyer.
  
  You may want to speak to a lawyer if any of these apply to you:

  * You have a child support order **from another state** but now you live in Michigan. In some circumstances, you may be able to have your case transferred to Michigan. However, this tool cannot help you do that.
  * There is a **bench warrant** against you for **non-payment of support**. This could happen if a motion to show cause was filed against you for non-payment of support, 
    you did not appear at the hearing, and the court issued a bench warrant against you.
  * You aren't sure what to do.
