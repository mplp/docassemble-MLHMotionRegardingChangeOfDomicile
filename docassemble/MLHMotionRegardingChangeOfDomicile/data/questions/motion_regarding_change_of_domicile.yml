question: |
  When do you need court permission?
subquestion: |
  If there is a custody or parenting-time order for your child, you will **always** need permission from the court to move them **outside of Michigan.**

  You **may** need permission from the court to move **within Michigan.** This depends on things like:

    * The custody and parenting-time arrangements
    * How far your proposed move is
    * How far you lived from the other parent when your case started
    * Whether the other parent agrees to the move

  To learn more about when you need the court's permission to move, read [Moving with Children after Separation or Divorce](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/family/moving-children-after-separation-or-divorce).

question: |
  You will now be asked why you want the judge to let you move.
subquestion: |
  The judge will consider whether:

    1. The move would improve your and your child’s quality of life;
    2. Each parent has followed the parenting-time provisions of your court order;
    3. You are using the move to limit the other parent’s time with your child;
    4. New parenting-time arrangements will allow your child to keep a similar relationship with the other parent;
    5. The other parent is fighting against the move just to pay less child support;
    6. You are moving to escape domestic violence by the other parent.

id: efile note question
question: |
  Completing this process does not file your forms with the court
subquestion: |
  You need to file them at court in person, by mail, e-mail, or by e-filing.
  If you are e-filing, you must use [MiFILE](https://mifile.courts.michigan.gov/).
  Read the instructions that you will get with your forms for more information.

  ${ collapse_template(am_i_going_to_efile) }

  This tool will create separate forms so you can more easily e-file using MiFILE, if you plan to e-file.
  
  This means that **you may need to download multiple files to get all of the forms you will need**. At the end of this interview you will see a list of documents to download. Make sure you download each of them. 

  You will also be able to get all forms you need by clicking the **Download Your Form(s)** button on the page at the end of this tool.

  How do I know if I am going to e-file?
content: |
  Not all courts offer e-filing at this time. To find out if your court has e-filing, read the
  [What is E-Filing?](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/mifile/what-e-filing) article.
  The article tells you how to find out which courts have e-filing and what kinds of cases those courts are accepting by e-filing.

  Look for the two-letter case type code at the end of your case number.
  (This could be DM, DC, DS, DP, or a different code.)

id: Electronic signature question
question: |
  Electronic Signature
subquestion: |
  This tool can put "*/s/ ${ users[0] }*" where you would sign your name so you do not have to sign the form by hand. The court will accept this as your signature.

  If you plan to e-file, you may want to add your electronic signature, otherwise you will need to print your forms, sign them by hand, and then scan them.

  ${ collapse_template(efiling_info_template) }
fields:
  - Would you like to add your electronic signature to your form?: esign
