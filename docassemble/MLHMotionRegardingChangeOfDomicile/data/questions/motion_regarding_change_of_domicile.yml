question: |
  When do you need court permission to move?
subquestion: |
  If there is a custody or parenting time order for your child, you **must** get the court’s approval before moving their residence outside Michigan.

  You **may** need permission from the court to move **within Michigan**. This depends on things like:

    * The custody and parenting time arrangements
    * How far your proposed move is
    * How far you lived from the other parent when your case started
    * Whether the other parent agrees to the move

  To learn more about when you need the court's permission to move, read [Moving with Children after Separation or Divorce](https://michiganlegalhelp.org/resources/family/moving-children-after-separation-or-divorce).

    2. Each parent has followed the parenting time provisions of your court order;
    3. You are using the move to limit the other parent’s time with your ${ "children" if len(children) > 1 else "child" };
    4. New parenting time arrangements will allow your ${ "children" if len(children) > 1 else "child" } to keep a similar relationship with the other parent;
    5. The other parent is fighting against the move just to pay less child support;
    6. You are moving to escape domestic violence by the other parent.

id: moving reason explanation
question: |
  Why do you want to move?
subquestion: |
  The court will want to know if you have a legitimate reason or reasons for moving. This is to make sure you aren’t moving just to limit the other parent’s ability to spend time with your ${ "children" if len(children) > 1 else "child" }.

  * Is for a better job that will give your family a better standard of living;
  * Is to a safer neighborhood;
  * Is to an area with better schools;
  * Will bring you closer to extended family; and
